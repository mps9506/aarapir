aarapir provides an R interface for querying and downloading publically accessible ArcGIS Online feature layers. The primary goal is to provide R users with an easy way to download features from ArcMap Online. I don't not anticipate this to be a full-fledged API to ArcGIS Online and Enterprise. See the [ArcGIS Python API](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-python-api) for a more robust access to the ArcGIS API. This is super experimental and likely to change. This project is not associated with or supported by ESRI.

## Features

- [x] Return mapservice information

- [x] Return feature layer information

- [x] Return full feature layers (will loop requests if the maximum number of records is limited)

- [x] Pass user query so only needed records are returned

- [ ] Return image service information

- [ ] Provide interface for image or tile data

## Example


Download a point feature layer:

```{r}
library(aarapir)
## Start with a mapserver url, these typically end in "/MapServer"
## Some examples here: https://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services

url <- "https://sampleserver6.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/WindTurbines/MapServer"

## This returns a list with information from the Map Service
webserver <- service_info(url)

## We can see what feature layers are available to download
webserver$layers

## This returns a list with information about the feature layer
## id 0
layerinfo <- layer_info(webserver, 0)

## This downloads the entire feature layer and reads it into a
## simple feature dataframe
dat <- layer_download(layerinfo)
dat


## If you want to return only objects from a query:
dat <- layer_download(layerinfo, query = "notes = 'test'")
## note query support might vary by server, but generally standard query functions
## work. more info: https://gisweb.tceq.texas.gov/arcgis/sdk/rest/index.html#/Query_Map_Service_Layer/02ss0000000r000000/
## enter the query in quoted plain text, the function will do the proper URI encoding
dat
```



## experimental

Downloading mosaiced images works. I'm having difficulty finding maps that allow downloading source rasters even though it is supported by the API. This is definately going to change.

```{r}
url <- "https://landsat2.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/Landsat8_Views/ImageServer"
webserver <- service_info(url)
r1 <- image_download(webserver,
                     size = "800,500",)
r1
raster::plotRGB(r1, r = 4, g = 3, b = 2, stretch = "lin",
                bgalpha = 0)
```
